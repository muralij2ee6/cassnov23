# On-line encyclopedia of integer sequences
You can use the `fetch_data.py` to download the sequences. However,
I actually found out (after filming the video) that you can literally
download all the sequences here:
https://oeis.org/wiki/Welcome#Compressed_Versions


So you should probably do that and spare their API.

# The GloVe embeddings
The one that I used in the video are located here:
